Hi there! I'm Mehak Razzaq ðŸ‘‹
I'm a BSCS student currently exploring the world of Full Stack Web and Android Development. I'm passionate about learning how real-world apps are built â€” from simple HTML pages to dynamic mobile applications.

Right now, I'm focusing on:

- Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Building responsive websites and practicing UI design
- Understanding Android development with Java
- Learning Git and version control

 ðŸš€ Goals:
- Build a solid portfolio with real-world projects
- Improve my communication and presentation skills
- Land my first internship or junior developer role by late 2025

ðŸ“Œ Things I'm trying to do better:
- Writing clean and readable code
- Documenting what I learn
- Staying consistent and learning every day (even when itâ€™s hard)
